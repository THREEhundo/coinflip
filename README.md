<h3 align="center">Coinflipping Web App.</h3>

- 🔭 How It's Made: **HTML, CSS, JS, and Node.js were used to build this web app. The randomization happens server side.**

- 🌱 Optimizations: **Replaced my attempts at janky animations with the Animate.css library. The simple and clean animations were easy to plug into the web app. Worked like a charm with minimal friction. I need to comb over the code to see if I can make the code a bit more DRY. I feel like there should be a way to condense all the product pages into a single page.**

- ⚡ Lessons Learned: **Libraries can be an amazing tool to leverage to get the results you want, fast. I've slowly started to let go of the idea that I need to create everything myself from the ground up. It is not feasible when working on a deadline. We all need help and learning how to seek it out has been a boon for me.**
